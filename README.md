# **Cyberbullying Comment Classification**  

This project is a web-based application designed to classify comments into two categories: **Cyberbullying** and **Not Cyberbullying**. Using advanced preprocessing techniques and a combination of traditional and deep learning models, the application analyzes comments to identify harmful or offensive language.  

## **Features**  
- **Data Collection**:  
  Comments were scraped from YouTube and Twitter using YouTube API v3 and Twitter API.  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Expanded contractions, removed punctuation, digits, and stopwords.  
  - Performed lemmatization using SpaCy and handled encoding issues.  
  - Preprocessed dataset was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.  
- **Machine Learning Models (Traditional)**:  
  - Logistic Regression (`lr_model.pkl`)  
  - Random Forest Classifier (`rf_model.pkl`)  
  - Naive Bayes (`nb_model.pkl`)  
  - Support Vector Machines (`svm_model.pkl`)  
  - Decision Tree (`dt_model.pkl`)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (`knn_model.pkl`)  
- **Deep Learning Models (Neural Networks)**:  
  - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) (`rnn_model.keras`)  
  - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (`lstm_model.keras`)  
- **Interactive Web Interface**:  
  Built using Flask, allowing users to input comments and receive predictions.  
- **Real-Time Predictions**:  
  The application provides instant predictions upon submission.  

## **Purpose**  
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability of machine learning models to identify harmful online behavior. It aims to assist in content moderation and contribute to a safer online environment.  

## **Technology Stack**  
- **Backend**: Python with Flask  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Fetch API for asynchronous communication)  
- **Models**: Pre-trained models stored in `.pkl` (traditional models) and `.keras` (deep learning models) formats  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - Flask  
  - scikit-learn  
  - nltk  
  - spacy  
  - contractions  
  - keras  
  - tensorflow  
  - joblib  
  - re

## **Example Comments for Testing**  
| **Comment**                          | **Expected Result** |  
|-------------------------------------|---------------------|  
| "You're such a loser."              | Cyberbullying       |  
| "Have a great day, my friend!"      | Not Cyberbullying   |  
| "Nobody likes you, just leave."     | Cyberbullying       |  
| "Let's catch up this weekend!"      | Not Cyberbullying   |  

## **Future Improvements**  
- **Expand Models**: Add more classifiers and compare their performance.  
- **Multi-class Classification**: Extend the application to identify subcategories of cyberbullying (e.g., racial, sexual, etc.).  
- **Interactive Feedback**: Allow users to report false predictions for model improvement.
